üíª Technical Skills & Focus Areas
This portfolio demonstrates proficiency in the following key technical domains:
Security Operations (SecOps): Incident Response, Threat Analysis, Vulnerability Assessment, SIEM (Conceptual).
System Hardening: Linux Command Line Interface (CLI), File Permissions (chmod), Access Control.
Data Analysis: SQL queries for forensic log filtering and data isolation.
Automation: Python scripting for automating security tasks (e.g., managing allow lists).
Foundations: Networking (TCP/IP), Cloud Infrastructure, IAM.

üõ†Ô∏è Featured Projects
The website details three primary security projects, focusing on practical application of tools and methodologies:
1. Linux Access Control Hardening
Goal: Enforce strict file permissions to prevent unauthorized execution and protect data integrity within a research directory.
Key Action: Used the chmod g-x drafts command in the Linux CLI to remove group execute permissions on critical file folders.
2. Incident Forensics: SQL Log Filtering
Goal: Isolate critical data points during a potential security incident for investigation.
Key Action: Wrote advanced MariaDB SQL queries to filter for failed login attempts after business hours and identify specific assets outside the IT department.
3. Security Automation: Python Allow List Manager
Goal: Automate the removal of unauthorized IP addresses from a system allow list.
Key Action: Developed a Python script using secure file I/O and filtering logic to streamline risk mitigation and eliminate manual errors in updating access controls.
